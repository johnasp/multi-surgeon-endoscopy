# Surgease multi proctor remote scoping tool

A prototype I coded to illustarate the in browser look & feel of a remote, multi-surgeo endoscopy web application which I created in HTML, SASS and vanilla Javascript, utlising CSS3 animations. 

Have a play around with the prototype I built here: https://scope-prototype.netlify.app/
